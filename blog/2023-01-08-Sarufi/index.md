Probably, you might have interacted with one while surfing through the internet as most website use them to deliver quick customer service. Let we have a quick grasp of knowledge on `what a chatbot is?`.

# Wrap Up

As I wrap up, I would like to clear some differences about `Conversational A.I` and `Chatbot`.
Conversational A.I(Artificial Intelligence) refers to tools/technologies that allow computer to carry out conversational experience with people. As for Cahtbots, they can be `Rule Based` or `A.I based(conversational)`. A Conversatonal Chatbots leverages the use of machine Learning(ML), Natural Language Processing(NLP) in order to understand the intents unlike Rule Based Chatbots which works as Tree-diagrams such as Automated Phone Menu
