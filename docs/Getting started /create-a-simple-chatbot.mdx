# Create your first Chatbot

As I mentioned in the previous section, that we only support [Python SDK](https://github.com/Neurotech-HQ/sarufi-python-sdk) for now and we will be adding more SDKs in the future.

We will be using [Python SDK](https://github.com/Neurotech-HQ/sarufi-python-sdk) for this tutorial. You can install it using the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```bash
pip install --upgrade sarufi
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```bash
npm install sarufi
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Draft Architecture

Before we start coding, let's first draft the architecture of our chatbot. Here an oversimplified version of the architecture for our chatbot. Sarufi will handle intents training, intent inference, and dialog management. We will be handling the application logic and the user interface.

![Oversimplified Architecture](/img/oversimplified-architecture.svg)

## Authentication

Before we start coding, we need to authenticate with Sarufi. Currently, we only support authentication your **username** and **password**. You can get your username and password. We still have't released the signup page yet. You can try out Sarufi by signing up for our [beta program](https://blog.neurotech.africa/what-is-sarufi/).

Once you're successfully accepted to our beta program, you will receive an email with your username and password. You can use the following code to authenticate with Sarufi.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```bash
>>> from sarufi import Sarufi
>>> sarufi = Sarufi(username="your-username", password="your-password")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```bash
> import sarufi from 'sarufi'
> sarufi.login({username: 'your-username', password: 'your-password'})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create Empty Chatbot

Now that we have successfully authenticated with Sarufi, we can create an empty chatbot, with 0 intents and 0 utterances. You can use the following code to create an empty chatbot.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
>>> from sarufi import Sarufi
>>> sarufi = Sarufi(username="your-username", password="your-password")
>>> chatbot = sarufi.create_bot(name='My First Chatbot')
2022-09-12 15:42:02,821 - root - INFO - Creating bot
>>> chatbot
Bot(id=13, name=My First Chatbot)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
> import sarufi from 'sarufi'
> sarufi.login({username: 'your-username', password: 'your-password'})
> await sarufi.createBot({bot:{name: "My Very First Chatbot"}})
{
  success: true,
  bot: {
    intents: {},
    user_id: 5,
    description: 'PUT DESCRIPTION HERE',
    industry: 'general',
    created_at: '2022-10-03T20:42:15.020288',
    name: 'My Very First Chatbot',
    flows: {},
    id: 45,
    model_name: 'models/a5e23069d80f8add72bad0969f00d5e0.pkl',
    visible_on_community: true,
    updated_at: '2022-10-03T20:42:15.020301'
  },
  chat: [Function: chat]
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
For python SDK, use `create_bot()` method to create a chatbot. For JavaScript SDK, use `createBot()` method to create an empty chatbot. For Python SDK a 'Bot' object is returned. For JavaScript SDK, a JSON object is returned.
:::

## Starting Conversation with our Chatbot

Now that we have successfully created an empty chatbot, we can start a conversation with our chatbot and see how it responds. You can use the following code to start a conversation with our chatbot.

Here is an example of how to start a conversation with our chatbot.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

You can either use `sarufi.chat()` method or `chatbot.respond()` to start a conversation with your chatbot. with `sarufi.chat()` method, you need to pass the `bot_id`, `chat_id` and the `message`. With `chatbot.respond()` method, you need to pass the `message` and `chat_id` only.

By default, `chat_id` is set to a random UUID. You can pass your own `chat_id` if you want to continue the conversation with the same user.

```python
>>> chatbot = sarufi.get_bot(13)
>>> chatbot.respond('Hey')
2022-09-12 15:44:02,811 - root - INFO - Sending message to bot and returning response
2022-09-12 15:44:07,078 - root - INFO - Status code: 200
2022-09-12 15:44:07,078 - root - INFO - Message sent successfully
{'message': 'Intent for this message is missing in [FLOW]'}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

You can either use `sarufi.chat()` method or `chatbot.chat()` method on the bot response.

The `chatbot.chat()` method takes a string as an input and returns a JSON object as an output. The JSON object contains `message` field which contains the response from our chatbot.

The `sarufi.chat()` method only takes the message, optional chat_id and bot_id

You will need to pass the `chat_id` and `message` to the `chat()` method. By default, `chat_id` is set to a random UUID. You can pass your own `chat_id` if you want to continue the conversation with the same user.

```js

//chatbot.chat()
> const chatbot = await sarufi.getBot({id: 45})
> await chatbot.chat({message: "Hey"})
{
  message: 'Intent for this message is missing in [FLOW]'
}

//sarufi.chat
> await sarufi.chat({ message: 'Hey', bot_id: 1 })

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
As you can see, our chatbot is not able to understand the message we sent but replied us with a predefined response. This is because we haven't trained our chatbot yet. We will be training our chatbot in the next section.
:::

Another cool way to test your chatbot is to use the Sarufi Playground. By Default when you create a chatbot, it is set to public. All you need to instantly test your chatbot is to go [Sarufi Community playground](https://playground.sarufi.io/community) and search for your chatbot.

## Help me order a pizza [Intent]

Let's now create an intent that will help us order a pizza and also add some utterances to that intent. You can use the following code to create an intent and add some utterances to that intent.

To make more interactive, let's general intents like `greets`, `order_pizza`, `goodbye` and add some utterances to those intents.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
>>> from sarufi import Sarufi
>>> sarufi = Sarufi(username="your-username", password="your-password")
>>> chatbot = sarufi.get_bot(13)
>>> chatbot.intents = {
...     'greets': ['hey', 'hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'hola', 'greetings', 'good morning', 'good afternoon', 'good evening'],
...     'goodbye': ['bye', 'goodbye', 'see you later', 'see you soon', 'see you', 'talk to you later', 'talk to you soon', 'talk to you'],
...     'order_pizza': ['I need a pizza', 'I want a pizza', 'order a pizza', 'I want to order a pizza']}
2022-09-12 15:55:06,696 - root - INFO - Updating bot
2022-09-12 15:55:07,972 - root - INFO - Bot(id=13, name=My First Chatbot)
>>> chatbot.intents
{'greets': ['hey', 'hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'hola', 'greetings', 'good morning', 'good afternoon', 'good evening'], 'goodbye': ['bye', 'goodbye', 'see you later', 'see you soon', 'see you', 'talk to you later', 'talk to you soon', 'talk to you'], 'order_pizza': ['I need a pizza', 'I want a pizza', 'order a pizza', 'I want to order a pizza']}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
> const chatbot = await sarufi.getBot({ id: 45 });
> const bot = {
  intents: {
    greets: [
      'hey',
      'hello',
      'hi',
      'howdy',
      'hola',
      'greetings',
      'good morning',
      'good afternoon',
      'good evening',
    ],
    goodbye: [
      'bye',
      'goodbye',
      'see you later',
      'see you soon',
      'see you',
      'talk to you later',
      'talk to you soon',
      'talk to you',
    ],
    order_pizza: [
      'I need a pizza',
      'I want a pizza',
      'order a pizza',
      'I want to order a pizza',
    ],
  },
};
 await sarufi.updateBot({ bot, id: chatbot.id });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Conversation with our chatbot after adding intents and utterances

Now that we have successfully added some intents and utterances to our chatbot, let's start a conversation with our chatbot and see how it responds. You can use the following code to start a conversation with our chatbot.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
>>> chatbot.respond("Hey")
2022-09-12 15:56:16,078 - root - INFO - Sending message to bot and returning response
2022-09-12 15:56:17,279 - root - INFO - Status code: 200
2022-09-12 15:56:17,279 - root - INFO - Message sent successfully
{'message': 'Intent for this message is missing in [FLOW]'}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
> await chatbot.chat({message: 'Hey'})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
You might wondering like but we trained it, yes ofcourse we trained it but we haven't given a flow on how to respond to the user. We will be adding a flow in the next section.
:::

## Help me order a pizza [Flow]

Flow is a directed graph that defines the conversation flow between the user and the chatbot. Flow is defined using the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format. where each node is an intent and each edge is a response to the user message & the next intent to be triggered.

:::note
You can have nodes that are not intents. In that case, the node will be treated as a response to the user message. If you want to end the conversation, you can add a node with the name `end`.
:::

Let's now add a flow to our chatbot. You can use the following code to add a flow to our chatbot.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python
>>> chatbot.flow = {
...     'greets': {
...         'message': ['Hi, How can I help you?'],
...         'next_state': 'end'
...     },
...     'order_pizza': {
...         'message': ['Sure, How many pizzas would you like to order?'],
...         'next_state': 'number_of_pizzas'
...     },
...     'number_of_pizzas': {
...         'message': ['Sure, What would you like to have on your pizza?'],
...         'next_state': 'pizza_toppings'
...     },
...     'pizza_toppings': {
...         'message': ['Cool, Whats your address ?'],
...         'next_state': 'address'
...     },
...     'address': {
...         'message': ['Sure, What is your phone number ?'],
...         'next_state': 'phone_number'
...     },
...     'phone_number': {
...         'message': ['Your order has been placed.', 'Thank you for ordering with us.'],
...         'next_state': 'end'
...     },
...     'goodbye': {
...         'message': ['Bye', 'See you soon'],
...         'next_state': 'end'
...     }
... }
```

    ],
    "next_state": "end"
  }
}
};
 await sarufi.updateBot({ bot, id: chatbot.id });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Conversation with our chatbot after adding flow

Now that we have successfully added a flow to our chatbot, let's start a conversation with our chatbot and see how it responds. You can use the following code to start a conversation with our chatbot.

```python
>>> chatbot.respond('Hey')
{'message': ['Hi, How can I help you?']}
>>> chatbot.respond('Bye')
{'message': ['Bye', 'See you soon']}
>>> chatbot.respond('I want to order pizza')
{'message': ['Sure, How many pizzas would you like to order?']}
>>> chatbot.respond('3')
{'message': ['Sure, What would you like to have on your pizza?']}
>>> chatbot.respond('tomato')
{'message': ['Cool, Whats your address ?']}
>>> chatbot.respond('123, Main Street, New York')
{'message': ['Sure, What is your phone number ?']}
>>> chatbot.respond('+255783483934')
{'message': ['Your order has been placed.', 'Thank you for ordering with us.']}
```

:::note
You can see that our chatbot is able to understand the user message and respond to the user message. This is because we have trained our chatbot with intents and utterances and also added a flow to our chatbot.
