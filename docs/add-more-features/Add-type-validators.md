# Adding Type Validators

After we have created our basic bot, We may need a way to validate the type of data a user gives the bot. We are going to make the bot more classic.

For example, you want the bot to receive a phone number for Pizza delivery or you want a user to provide an email address. Thats all **type validation** has to do.

Using type validation we are going to achieve this fuctionality with few statements.

## What we have now

By now, we support following validations:- `Alphanumeric` , `Date` , `Email` , `Length` , `numeric` , `Phone number` , `required field` , `time` and `Zipcode`.

Lets have a quick walk through these validators.

|Validator       | Type name      |      Description        |    Example     |
|---                    |---             |---                       |---              |
|Alphanumeric (üî† or üî¢)| `alphanumeric_validation`| Accepts alphabets, numbers or both| 123wdcs or  1122 or adasd|
|Date üìÜ|`date_validation`|accepts date in format **dd/mm/yyyy** or **mm/dd/yyyy**|24/3/2023 or 3/24/2023|
|Email ‚úâÔ∏è|`email_validation`| Ensures that a user has entered an email|hello123@yourdomain.com or hello.me@domain.com|
|Length|`length_validation`| Validates amount of data user enters|name with characters between 10 and 20|
|Numeric üî¢|`numeric_validation`|Accepts digits with no decimal|1233|
|Phone number üìû|`phone_number_validation`|Accepts a phone number |+2(222)22222222 or +2(222)222-222 or +255711111111 or 0711111111|
|Required field|`required_field_validation`|Enforces a user to provide a response|Customer must provide an input|
|Time üïò|`time_validation`|Accepts time in the format `hh:mm AM or PM`. **Note:**A space between `mm` and `AM/PM`|12:00 AM|
|Zipcode üì´|`zipcode_validation`|Accepts zipcode |12345 or 12345-6789 or 12345 6789|

The `type name` is name that will used to add the validator to the bot's flow. We have examples below.

## Get into action

Validators will be added in the flow of your chatbot. They take `type name` as **type** and `validator error message` as **error_message**.

The **type** will be one of the validators we have discussed above and *error_message* this is a response from the bot whenever a user enters non valid input.

We are going to use add validator to our Pizza bot. Lets add numeric and phone number validators.

<Tabs groupId="type_validator">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

Lets update our `flows.yaml` file by adding few lines.

```yaml
greets:
  message:
    - 'Hi, How can I help you?'
  next_state: end

order_pizza:
  message:
    - 'Sure, How many pizzas would you like to order?'
  # numeric validation added here
  validators:
    - type: numeric_validation
      error_message: 'Please enter a valid number'
  next_state: number_of_pizzas

number_of_pizzas:
  message:
    - 'Sure, What would you like to have on your pizza?'
  next_state: pizza_toppings

pizza_toppings:
  message:
    - 'Cool, Whats your address ?'
  next_state: address

address:
  message:
    - 'Sure, What is your phone number ?'
  #phone number validation added
  validators:
    - type: 'phone_number_validation'
      error_message:
        - 'Please enter a valid phone number like 0711111111 or +255711111111 or +(222)222-2222'
  next_state: 'phone_number'

phone_number:
  message:
    - Your order has been placed.
    - Thank you for ordering with us.
  next_state: end

goodbye:
  message:
    - Bye
    - See you soon
  next_state: end
```

After we have updated our flow, its time we update our bot. Running the command below magic all magic happen.

```python
>>> from sarufi import Sarufi
>>> sarufi = Sarufi("testing@gmail.com", "xxxxxx")
>>> # We only update the flow
>>> response = sarufi.update_from_file(
...     flow="data/flows.yaml",
...     id="your bot id"
... )
```

Length validation takes some additional information, i have it explained at [more on length validation](#one-thing-to-note).

## See the outcome

Now we have validators added to our bot, lets test our bot in the playground.

- ‚ùå Unexpected input

  Here is when the user enters a wrong/unexxpected input that does not match selected validator rules. I will try providing a *string* instead of a *number*. The bot responds with **error_message** we set.

  ![Validator: Wrong input](/img/validator-wrong-input.png)

- ‚òëÔ∏è Expected input

  When the user sends a matching input to the set validator, the conversion will go on. Here are some conversations.

  ![Validators: Matching inputs](/img/validator-correct-input.png)

You can see how the use of validators will give your bot a more meaningful conversation experience üöÄ.

## One thing to note

All other validators, you just enter validator `name` and `error message` exccept `length validator`.

For length validation, we shall have some additional information to add. We are going to add **min_length** and **max_length**.

Here is an example for yaml and json file.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="Yaml">

```yaml
get_name:
message:
  - Please provide Your full name
next_state: get_email
validators:
  - type: length_validation
    error_message: sorry, provide a name with characters between 7 and 30
    min_length: 7
    max_length: 30
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="Json">

```js
"get_name": {
  "message": ["Please provide Your full name"],
  "next_state": "get_email",
  "validators": [
    {
      "type": "length_validation",
      "error_message": "sorry, provide a name with characters between 7 and 30",
      "min_length": 7,
      "max_length": 30
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
