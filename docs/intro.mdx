# What is Sarufi ?

[Sarufi](https://sarufi.io/) is a third-party conversational AI(Chatbot) platform built from ground up to make it easy for developers to build chatbots and integrate them with their applications or messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.

It is a `lightweight`, `blazingly fast` platform tailored to excel at _African languages_.

It handles all the _heavy lifting_ of building a conversational bot, including: _intent detection_, _entity recognition_, _natural language understanding_, and _intent fulfillment_. You don't need to worry about the details like how the bot is trained, how it is deployed, or how it is used in production anymore and you can focus on building your bot.
