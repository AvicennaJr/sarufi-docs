# create chabot from document

With sarufi you can easily create a chabot containing some of your company doucments that people can ask about. With this feature you will be able to create a bot in a faster way. The document can be of format pdf,docs or text files. All you need to do is just uploading your file.

You will need to know about some few concepts though. We shall take a look at prompts, temperature and memory.

A prompt  is a short piece of text that guides a chatbot to generate a specific response. It can be used to control the chatbot's persona, tone, strictness, and language. By carefully crafting the prompt, you can control the chatbot's responses to a high degree of precision

A max token  value is the maximum number of words a chatbot can process in a single interaction. Setting a high max token value will allow the chatbot to generate more complex responses, but it will also take longer and cost more.

Temperature is a parameter that controls the creativity of a chatbot's responses. For example, a chatbot with a high temperature is more likely to generate creative and unexpected responses, while a chatbot with a low temperature is more likely to generate conservative and predictable responses.

Lets get an idea of what is a token. A we deal with NLP models process texts by chunking them into small groups/chunks of words or letters. The model set with many token will have ability to process large chunks of text but this comes with cost and letacy issues.
